        <h2>My Love for Music has Turned Into a Very Expensive Hobby</h2>
        <p>I have always loved music. As a young child, I participated in both band (playing the flute), and choir (alternating between alto and soprano depending on which section more of my friends were in). I frequently spend birthday money on cassette tapes of my favorite artists and blank tapes to record my favorite singles off of the radio. As I have grown, I discovered that my love for music was something I could take with me no matter where I went and was something I could share with friends. My love for concerts grew into a passion and I now attend a dozen or so per year. Here are a few of my favorites...</p>

            <h3>My Girls</h3>
            <p>My absolute favorite performers of all-time are my daughters, Jordan and Jessica. They have grown up with music and have become performers themselves. Jordan recently performed a violin solo for a solo competition where she received top marks. Jessica plays several instruments (flute, piccolo, piano, violin) and recently played her first solo performance as well. I have been to many professional concerts, but these performances are the most amazing shows I have seen by far.</p>

                <h3>Bon Jovi</h3>
                <p>Bon Jovi has been my favorite band for as long back as I can remember. I first heard one of his songs on a friend's walkman on the playground of my elementary school. One of my first "real" concerts was Bon Jovi and I made sure both of my daughters had the same experience, only at a much younger age. For Bon Jovi's most recent tour, I made sure to get tickets right away, but I ended up winning a radio contest and received <b>FRONT ROW SEATS</b> and a behind the scenes experience. This was a bucket list experience for sure! I would never have spent that kind of money on front row seats, even for my favorite artist. It was an amazing concert and that day was one of the best days of my life.</p>

                <h3>Cyndi Lauper</h3>
                <p>Growing up, Cyndi Lauper was always a close second for my favorite artist. She is an enthusiastic performer and her music has always made me happy. The first time I ever saw her live was at the Arch riverfront for an Independence Day concert. In a moment of encouraged braveness, my husband convinced me to make our way to the (standing only) front row. It was an amazing experience.</p>

                <h3>Christina Perri</h3>
                <p>Christina Perri is a young singer-songwriter best known for her song "A Thousand Years," featured in a Twilight movie. She became famous when the show "Dancing with the Stars" played her song "Jar of Hearts" for a finale performance. I love her amazing voice and soulful melodies. When she visited St. Louis in 2016, we splurged and bought our whole family backstage passes. She an extremely nice person and I was grateful to give my daughters the experience of meeting an amazing singer and role model.</p>

                <h3>Andy Grammer</h3>
                <p>I'd always been a fan of Andy's song "Keep Your Head Up," but when I saw him at a holiday variety show a few years ago, I fell in love with his music. He started out as a street performer in LA and clearly loves his job. His performance was passionate and deeply personal. As a singer-songwriter he writes about life experiences and as a result, is very relatable. He has had much success with the last few albums, but remains humble. He recently performed at the Arch riverfront and I was able to bring my family. Even though it was a free concert, it was one of the best shows I have ever seen.</p>
